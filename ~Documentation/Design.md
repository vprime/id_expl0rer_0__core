# id_expl0rer_0 Game Design

## Focus

The focus is to create a game for the Motorola Symbol/Zebra WT4090 Wearable Computer.
Why? because we can, it's a neat little device and it's a shame that the primary use is boring old warehouse work. I think it deserves some fun too.
The game may be ported, but the primary platform is WT4090.

#### Design constraints:
- Focus on the hardware features
- No sensor data (Physical activity recording is out without external hardware)
- No or unimportant multiplayer functionality
- Plays over a long period of time with minor input required from user


## Summary

id_expl0rer is a digital pet game for the WT4090 wearable computer.


## Gameplay

The game is played on a device on a screen that can collect wireless and barcode data.

#### Gameplay Ideas:
- Scan barcodes to generate pets
- Scan Wifi signals to generate explorable land
- Scan bluetooth signals to find items or opponents
- Persistent autosave. Allow user to close the game immediately without data loss.
- Lifecycles
  - Start as an egg
  - Hatch into a baby
  - Grow into a child
  - Grow into a teen
  - Grow into an adult
- Care
  - Pet needs to be fed
    - Special food can be aquired from collected data
  - Pet will make messes which need to be cleaned

    - Messes in the wrong spot
  - Illness & Medicine
    - Pet could get sick periodicly
    - Messy, hunger, and low play could increase likelyhood of illness
    - Illness can be cured with medicine
    - Special medicine can be aquired through collected data
- Play
  - Pets can be taken on walks through spaces generated by local wireless signals.
  - Harvest items like food, medicine, and toys in generated land.
  - Battle system
